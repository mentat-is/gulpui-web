# Gulp Web Client Setup Documentation

There are three options for setting up the Gulp web client depending on your needs: Production version, Development version, and Deploying a downloadable build on your server.

## 1. Production Version

To set up the production version of `gulpui-web`, follow these steps:

### Requirements:
- **Git**
- **Node.js** version > 20.15.0
- **npm** version > 10.7.0

### Installation:
1. Open a terminal and run the following commands:
    ```sh
    git clone https://<your-repository-url>/
    cd gulpui-web
    npm ci
    npm run build
    ```

2. Once the build completes successfully, navigate to the `/build` directory and launch a local server. You can use `LiveServer` or any other static file server.

3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the production build.

## 2. Development Version

For development, you can run `gulpui-web` in watch mode, which automatically reloads after any code changes.

### Requirements:
- **Git**
- **Node.js** version > 20.15.0
- **npm** version > 10.7.0

### Installation:
1. Open a terminal and run the following commands:
    ```sh
    git clone https://<your-repository-url>/
    cd gulpui-web
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

2. When you modify any files in the `/src` directory, the `gulpui-web` will automatically reload to reflect changes.

## 3. Downloadable Build for Deployment on Your Own Server

To deploy `gulpui-web` on your server, follow these steps:

### Steps:
1. Visit the official [Gulp Web Client GitHub repository](https://github.com/mentat-is/gulpui-web).
2. Navigate to the **Releases** tab.
3. Download the latest stable version as a zip file.
4. Extract the zip file to a location of your choice.
5. Copy the files from the extracted folder into the `htdocs` (or equivalent) folder on your web server.

---

## 4. Accessing from a Gulp Server

If the web client is hosted on a Gulp server, you can access it by navigating to the following address in your browser:

```sh
http://<gulp-server-ip>:80/
```

Make sure to replace `<gulp-server-ip>` with the actual IP address of the server hosting the `gulpui-web`.

## Notes

The `@` symbol is used as an alias for the root `/src` directory. For example:
```js
  // instead of:
  import { LoginPage } from '../../app/login/page'

  // write:
  import { LoginPage } from '@/app/login/page'
```

## 5. Accessing the Internal Logs
To access the internal logs of the application, you can open the command line interface (CLI) by pressing F8. This will open a console with all the logs generated by the program, allowing you to inspect any issues or debug information.

### Exporting Logs for Bug Reporting
If you need to report a bug or an issue, you can export all the logs into a file that can be attached to a GitHub issue.

1. Press F8 to open the command line.
2. Type the command export and press Enter.
3. The logs will be saved into a file named gulpui-web_log_<timestamp>.log.
4. This log file can be used when creating a new issue in GitHub, providing valuable context to help developers diagnose the problem.
It is recommended to include the exported logs in your GitHub issues to assist in quicker resolution of bugs.
